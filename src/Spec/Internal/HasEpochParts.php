/**
 * Backing storage and accessors for the over-int64 instant representation shared by

 *
 * Both classes carry the same instant as a triple — the public {@see $epochNanoseconds}
 * field (clamped to a PHP_INT_MIN/MAX sentinel once the true value overflows int64) plus
 * the carried {@see $trueEpochSec}/{@see $trueSubNs} pair that survives that clamp. This
 * trait owns those three fields and the two operations on them so the
 * "epochNanoseconds is a sentinel iff trueEpochSec !== null" invariant lives in exactly
 * one place rather than being re-asserted by hand in each class:
 *
 *   - {@see epochParts()} — decodes the triple back into (epochSec, subNs), routing
 *     through {@see EpochValue::parts()} so sentinels are handled transparently.
 *   - {@see applyEpoch()} — stamps the carried true parts from a single {@see EpochValue},
 *     the canonical encoder of the int64-fit / sentinel rule.
 *
 * {@see $epochNanoseconds} is `readonly` and is therefore still assigned directly by each
 * using class's constructor (the only place a readonly field may be written) from the same
 * {@see EpochValue} that {@see applyEpoch()} consumes; the two together spread one object,
 * never a hand-built triple.
