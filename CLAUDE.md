# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A PHP 8.4 implementation of the [TC39 Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/). See `README.md` for a tour of the public API, deliberate deviations from TC39, and the backwards-compatibility contract.

## Running commands

Everything runs inside the `php` container. The user usually has `docker compose up -d` running already; if not, start it. **Do not invoke `php` / `composer` / `node` on the host** — always go through the service:

```bash
docker compose exec php composer <script>
docker compose exec php vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite porcelain
docker compose exec php vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testName tests/Porcelain/PlainDateTest.php
```

Composer scripts (defined in `composer.json`):

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test` | All PHPUnit suites |
| `test262:build` | Transpile `tests/Test262/data/*.js` → `tests/Test262/scripts/*.php` (runs `node tools/transpile-test262.mjs` then `mago format`) |
| `test262:run` | Run only the transpiled test262 conformance suite |
| `test262:sync` | Refresh `tests/Test262/data/` from upstream tc39/test262 (`tools/sync-test262.sh`) |
| `phpstan` / `psalm` / `mago` | Static analysis (PHPStan level 9, Psalm level 1, Mago lint+analyze) |
| `infection` | Mutation testing (target: 100% MSI) |
| `check` | Full gate: phpstan + psalm + mago + mago-format-check + test-coverage + infection |

PHPUnit suites (`phpunit.xml`): `default` (everything except Porcelain/Test262), `porcelain`, `test262`.

## Architecture

Two parallel, fully supported public API tiers plus an internal core:

- **`Temporal\`** (porcelain) — `src/*.php`. Idiomatic PHP: strict types, backed enums, named arguments, readonly value objects. What application code should normally use.
- **`Temporal\Spec\`** (spec layer) — `src/Spec/*.php`. TC39-faithful surface, validated by the test262 conformance suite. Public API, not internal. Mirrors the porcelain class set 1:1.
- **`Temporal\Spec\Internal\`** — genuine implementation detail. Calendar protocol/bridges (ECMA-402 calendars via `ext-intl`, plus pure-PHP Hebrew/Indian implementations), serde, calendar math. Free to break across versions; do not import from outside `Temporal\Spec\`.

Each porcelain class has a matching spec class and pairs of `toSpec()` / `fromSpec()` for round-tripping. Every porcelain↔spec seam is covered by the BC promise (`X::fromSpec($x->toSpec()) === $x` within a major).

Shared property/getter logic lives in `src/Trait/Has*Properties.php` (porcelain) and `Has*Spec.php` (spec). When adding a field that crosses several classes, look for the relevant trait first.

## test262 conformance suite

`tests/Test262/data/` — verbatim mirror of upstream tc39/test262 JS files. **Do not edit these.** If a test fails, fix the implementation. `tests/Test262/data/CLAUDE.md` has the rules.

`tests/Test262/scripts/` — generated PHP transpiled from the JS. **Do not hand-edit.** Regenerate via `composer test262:build`. The scripts are loaded by `tests/Test262/RunnerTest.php` against the `Temporal\Spec\` layer.

## Quality bar

PHPStan level 9, Psalm error level 1, Mago lint+format clean, 100% mutation kill (Infection). The `composer check` script is the gate every PR must pass. Don't suppress warnings — fix the underlying types.

## Git worktrees

Sub-feature branches are sometimes checked out into `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`. When working in a worktree, stay in it — don't reach back into the main repo path.
